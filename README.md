# Bachelor Finishment Thesis
This repository contains codes which is used in my Industry Engineering based "RFID based emission and gate queue research" thesis project. Contents maybe updated years later, who knows.

As it's has my own thesis codes, so you can't just clealy copy it and used it in your "own" thesis or any other academical works. But, since this is a open repository, you can inspire from my works. You get it what i mean 😉🤞🏻

Ooh, i almost forgot about it. Give some credits if you inspired from any part of my project. GL and thanks.
